# SIMPLE SHELL

## DESCRIPTION

This project is carried out in order to test all the knowledge obtained throughout the program, we must make our own command reader (Shell) and understand in depth all the processes that are executed when an order is given to the terminal .

## CONTENT

The files included in our repository that make our program work are:

* _shell.c
* _dot.
* _env.c
* _execute.nb.c
* _execute.c
* _exit.c
* _getenv.c
* _strcat.c
* _strcmp.c
* _strdup.c
* shell.h
* split_string.c

## HOW IT WORKS

For our program to work properly you must:
receive an instruction (command)
read command
run it if correct
show error message to be the opposite

## IMPORTANT

As we are creating functions because we have requirements to fulfill, these functions are included in a header file called shell.h, without this file the program will not compile as it must not recognize the created functions.

## NOTES
Currently our program can read and execute commands interactively and non-interactively
